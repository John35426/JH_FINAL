    <h1>Biggest whales in the oceans today</h1>

    <div class="main-content">
        <p>Blue whales are the largest animals to have ever lived on Earth. Their massive size and graceful movements make them an awe-inspiring sight.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/bluewhale1.png" alt="Blue Whale">
        <p>Despite their enormous size, blue whales primarily feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures. These whales consume tons of krill every day!</p>
        <img src="assets/images/bluewhale2.png" alt="Blue Whale">
        <p>They produce the loudest sounds of any animal, using low-frequency calls that travel great distances underwater, making them one of the most vocal creatures in the ocean.</p>

        <p>These majestic whales face numerous threats but continue to be a symbol of the power and beauty of the natural world. Efforts to conserve them are vital for their survival.</p>
